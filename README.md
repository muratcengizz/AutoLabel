# AutoLabel
Introduction:
 

The project has been developed to automate data collection and data labeling processes in image processing projects and optimize the workflow. This project automatically saves frames using pre-trained models, records the x, y, w, h coordinates of detected objects on these frames, and necessary data in txt-xml-json formats according to your needs. You can also automatically split the collected frames and labels into training and test sets if desired. This project supports labeling formats required by models such as Yolo, SSD, Tensorflow, and Pytorch, making it much easier to create custom models. For example, if you have a model that detects cars but want to identify and classify specific car brands according to your needs, you can automatically label car brands within seconds using your pre-trained model.

Workflow:
Within the project folder, you should provide suitable values for variables in the configuration.yaml file named "configuration.yaml." Then, you should use the functions shown in the documentation during the prediction process.
